The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if you use it with multiple units (e.g., pixels and percentages) and the browser cannot resolve it to a single unit, it can lead to unexpected rendering behavior. For example, the calculation `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might work fine, but `width: calc(100px - 50%);` might not, because the browser cannot accurately calculate the difference between pixels and percentages without knowing the container's width.
