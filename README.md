# CSS calc() Calculation Issues with Mixed Units

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function when using multiple units (e.g., pixels and percentages).  The browser may have difficulty resolving the calculation if the units are incompatible, resulting in unexpected rendering behavior.  This can lead to layout problems that are difficult to debug.

The `bug.css` file showcases the problem. The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution.  The solution demonstrates using consistent units or alternative approaches to achieve the desired layout.
