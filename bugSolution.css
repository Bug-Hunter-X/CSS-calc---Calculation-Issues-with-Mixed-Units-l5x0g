There are several approaches to solve this.  The most common is to ensure consistent units within the `calc()` expression.  If you need a pixel value based on a percentage, calculate the percentage based on the parent container dimensions using JavaScript (or a CSS preprocessor) and apply the resulting pixel value.  Alternatively, consider using different layout techniques, such as flexbox or grid, to achieve the desired layout without relying on complex `calc()` expressions.
